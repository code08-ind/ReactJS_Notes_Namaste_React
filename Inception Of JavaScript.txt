Episode 1 Inception Of JavaScript

We can create an element in html by using javascript, this can be done by using the document.createElement("h1") and then appending it inside a different element in the document.

We can even include the cdn links of react.js and we can also include react here. Now browser can understand the react code.

CDN Links: These CDN Links will include all of the random shit

<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

crossorigin: 

The crossorigin attribute in HTML's <script> tag sets the request mode to an HTTP CORS Request. It's used to load an external script into a domain from a third-party server or another domain. 

The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

This attribute is used to protect sensitive information from the third party when fetching out the results. It also defines how the element handles cross-origin requests. 

Cross-origin requests are requests for a resource from another domain. These resources may include style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts. The crossorigin attribute is valid on the following elements: <audio>, <img>, <link>, <script>, <video>. 

Now we have the React code inside our repository and we can do anything about here in React. We also have some Secret Internals: Don't use otherwise you will be fired. Hahaha !!!

Second cdn is basically combining off to provide the tools for the React DOM.

const heading = React.createElement("h1",{class:"head", id:"hello"},"Hello World"). We also need a root that will be created by ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")). Then we have to use render method, root.render(heading). We can also give attributes here using it.

This is the real JavaScript. Most expensive operation in DOM is when we change some nodes or we either put some updates in DOM.

React will go to manipulating dom using React.

We will include multiple children inside the child nesting simply because. We add an object and while it is rendering, that itself converts that object into an HTML DOM. We can also add more than one child here, so we can just use the array of children. We need a key to for each unique child.

React can be written using the javascript as well in place of the jsx. Order of files matter as this will allow us to make use of the libraries and for it we need the actual javascript file need to be used later after the use of library files.

If there is anything inside the div#root, anmd if we add something inside the div#root externally, then that will replace the text that will be already be there inside the div#root.

React is a Library as everything is created on only a single page itself.
