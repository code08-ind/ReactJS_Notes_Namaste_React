1. **Prop drilling**: Prop drilling refers to the practice of passing data down from one component to another component through props, even if intermediate components do not need that data. It can lead to less maintainable and more complex code, especially in large component trees.

2. **Lifting state up**: Lifting state up is the process of moving state from a lower-level component to a higher-level component in the component hierarchy. This is done when multiple components need access to the same state data or when state needs to be shared between sibling components. By lifting state up, you centralize the state management, making the application easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Context Provider and Context Consumer**: Context in React allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. A Context Provider is a component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. It provides the context data to all its descendant components. Context Consumer is a component that subscribes to context changes and access the context data provided by the nearest Context Provider in the component hierarchy.

4. **Default value in Context Provider**: Yes, if you don't pass a value to the Context Provider, it will use the default value provided in the `createContext` function. For example:

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

const MyContext = createContext('default value');

const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  // Provider component
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={'value passed to provider'}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  // Consumer component
  const value = useContext(MyContext);
  return <div>{value}</div>;
};

export { MyProvider, MyComponent };
```

In this example, if you don't pass a value to `MyProvider`, it will use `'default value'` as the default value for `MyContext`.
