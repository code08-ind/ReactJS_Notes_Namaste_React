1. **Difference between Named Export, Default Export, and * as Export**:
   - **Named Export**: Allows you to export multiple variables, functions, or classes from a module by explicitly naming them. These exports need to be imported by their exact names.
     ```javascript
     // module.js
     export const foo = 'foo';
     export function bar() { /* code */ }
     ```
     ```javascript
     // import.js
     import { foo, bar } from './module';
     ```
   - **Default Export**: Allows you to export a single variable, function, or class from a module, which can then be imported using any name. There can only be one default export per module.
     ```javascript
     // module.js
     const baz = 'baz';
     export default baz;
     ```
     ```javascript
     // import.js
     import baz from './module';
     ```
   - **\* as Export**: Allows you to import all exported members from a module under a single namespace.
     ```javascript
     // module.js
     export const a = 'a';
     export const b = 'b';
     ```
     ```javascript
     // import.js
     import * as moduleExports from './module';
     console.log(moduleExports.a); // 'a'
     console.log(moduleExports.b); // 'b'
     ```

2. **Importance of config.js file**:
   - A `config.js` file is often used to store configuration settings for an application.
   - It allows developers to centralize configuration settings, making it easier to manage and update.
   - It enhances maintainability by separating configuration from application logic, making the codebase cleaner and more organized.
   - It facilitates environment-specific configurations (e.g., development, production, testing) by allowing different configurations to be stored in separate files or by using environment variables.
   - It improves security by providing a single location to manage sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, etc., which can be easily encrypted or protected.

3. **React Hooks**:
   - React Hooks are functions that enable functional components to manage state and side effects.
   - They were introduced in React 16.8 to address issues related to state management and code reuse in functional components.
   - Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component.
   - Commonly used hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, etc.
   - They follow specific naming conventions (prefixed with "use") and enable you to use stateful logic in functional components, making them more expressive and composable.

4. **Need for useState Hook**:
   - `useState` is a React Hook used for adding state to functional components.
   - Prior to the introduction of hooks, functional components were stateless and couldn't hold or manage their state.
   - With `useState`, functional components can now have their own state, allowing them to re-render when state changes occur.
   - It simplifies state management in functional components, reducing the need for class components.
   - `useState` returns a stateful value and a function to update that value, enabling developers to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
   - It improves performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders through the use of the state update function returned by `useState`.
