# Personal Branding

The image we want others to see of us, we only show that to the people here. It is only done to create a perception about you. Here we create a perception to create an authority of over the other people. We elevate ourselves and differentiating from other people.

People should know exactly what are you doing in your daily life for working or for forming a type of influencer or the work we do here. 

Content should be interesting, best DS videos are present over the NPTL.

Multiple Rehearsals are done before coming for the final release. Attire is kept consistent here. 

We have to be unique, don't fake things up. Be honest towards to your work here.

Everybody is a Personal Brand In Themselves.

Don't seek motivation from anyone for every topic.
