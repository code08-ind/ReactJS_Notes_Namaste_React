    NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript programming language. It's the default package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to easily install, manage, and share packages of code.

    Parcel and Webpack are both module bundlers, tools that take your JavaScript and other assets and bundle them together for use in a web browser. We need them to handle various tasks like transpiling, minifying, and optimizing code, as well as managing dependencies and enabling features like code splitting and hot module replacement.

    .parcel-cache is a directory created by Parcel to cache build artifacts and speed up subsequent builds.

    npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher. It allows you to execute Node packages without having to install them globally.

    dependencies are packages required for the application to run, while devDependencies are packages only needed during development (like testing frameworks or build tools).

    Tree shaking is a technique used in JavaScript to remove dead code (unused code) from a bundle, resulting in smaller bundle sizes.

    Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in module bundlers like Webpack and Parcel that allows modules to be replaced in the running application without a full reload, providing a faster development experience.

    Some favorite superpowers of Parcel are:
        Zero Configuration: Parcel requires no configuration to get started.
        Automatic Asset Resolution: It automatically resolves and bundles various asset types, like CSS, images, and HTML.
        Efficient Code Splitting: Parcel intelligently splits bundles to improve load times.

    .gitignore is a file used to specify intentionally untracked files to ignore in Git repositories. Generally, you should add files and directories that are generated during the build process or contain sensitive information.

    package.json is a manifest file for a Node.js project, while package-lock.json is automatically generated by npm to lock down the version of dependencies installed. You shouldn't modify package-lock.json directly because npm manages it for you based on your package.json and node_modules.

    node_modules is a directory where npm installs project dependencies. It's not a good idea to push it to Git because it can be regenerated from package.json and package-lock.json.

    The dist folder (short for distribution) contains the final build artifacts of your project, optimized and ready for deployment.

    browserslist is a configuration file used by tools like Babel and Autoprefixer to determine which browsers to support based on specific criteria (like market share or versions). It helps ensure compatibility with targeted browsers.
