1. **useContext vs Redux**:
   - `useContext`: It's a React hook used for accessing context in a functional component. It allows components to subscribe to context changes without introducing a higher-order component.
   - Redux: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It's commonly used with React to manage the application state.

2. **Advantage of using Redux Toolkit over Redux**:
   - Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux usage by providing utility functions to reduce boilerplate code. It includes utilities like `configureStore`, `createSlice`, and `createAsyncThunk` to streamline common Redux patterns. It encourages writing Redux code in a more standardized and efficient way.

3. **Dispatcher**:
   - The dispatcher is a central hub in Redux that receives actions and forwards them to reducers. It is responsible for dispatching actions to update the state of the application.

4. **Reducer**:
   - A reducer is a pure function in Redux responsible for handling state transitions based on dispatched actions. It takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state. Reducers should be pure functions, meaning they should not modify the state directly but return a new state object.

5. **Slice**:
   - In Redux Toolkit, a slice is a portion of the Redux state along with its associated reducers and actions. It encapsulates the logic for managing a specific part of the application state. Slices are created using the `createSlice` function.

6. **Selector**:
   - Selectors are functions used to extract specific pieces of data from the Redux store. They provide a way to compute derived data from the Redux state. Selectors are often used to encapsulate access to specific parts of the state and compute derived values.

7. **createSlice and its configuration**:
   - `createSlice` is a function provided by Redux Toolkit for creating Redux slices. It takes an object with configuration options including:
     - `name`: A string name for the slice.
     - `initialState`: The initial state of the slice.
     - `reducers`: An object containing reducer functions for handling actions related to the slice. These reducers are automatically generated by `createSlice` based on the provided functions.

By using `createSlice`, Redux Toolkit generates action creators and action types for each reducer automatically, reducing the boilerplate code needed to set up Redux actions and reducers.
