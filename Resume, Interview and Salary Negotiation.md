Recruitment Ratio for the number of candidates applying and number of hiring is just 1-2% in big companies.

Skills section is what the Recruiters Look For.

If a person is looking for the React Role, First Skill should be React.js.

The Recruiters find also the candidate for the Number of years of experience. WE should not enter the number of years here. They also look for the last working experience.

Good College is given more preference. We can also write our GPA there.

Work Experience: It will also include some of the keywords that the recruiters might be looking for.The number of years of experience is seen here.

Contact Information is one of the important things that must be focused on. (Phone Number, LinkedIn ID and Email Address) should be added there.

Address is not required to be added here in the Resume.

Technical Interviewers: They will be concerned about our projects. Recent Projects we have worked upon.

We don't need to put our college project inside the resume if we are quite experienced.

Technical Interviewer: He gives only 2-3 mins to read the interview. They only focus on the Projects and skills Only. If you can explain one project, you will be able to see the changes.

Just add 2-3 lines for the previous company.

Projects: Recent Project and Most Challenging Projects. Put down good keywords here in the Resume skills section. Keywords should be technical in nature, eg. I developed Youtube Clone x. Right format is Video Streaming Platform that could have various of the videos here. I

Give GitHub and Working Demo Link Here In The Resume Infront of Each Project.

We could also add Certifications, Achievements in the section.

We should also mention if we have won a employee of quarter or employee of the month award.

The Resume should be only one page long.

### INTERVIEWES:

Introduction Prepare It

Top Down Approach: Company -> Team > Project

Start Describing High Level Details About You and Projects

You should not stop until the Interviewer asks us to stop telling about the Resume and things we are good in learning, Recent Project, Challenging Parts of Project.

Technical Rounds, Towards the end: Ask good questions?, Don't ask about feedback, Use this time to know about team/ company (what you do in team?), What tech stack do you use in the company, Do you use any testing framework in the team inside the project?, Are there any code review practices?, Do you do system design? What is the team culture in the team?

If anything went bad such as the internet goes off, charging gets off, so this becomes a panic state here.

### Salary Negotiation

There is always a chance of Increment if we get the offer, and it is upto us if we can get the increment or not.4

First Offer is not the final offer. We should ask for the better package, and we can ask always to tell what is the better money. How we can ask for the right offer.

HR will never feel bad if we are negotiating, it is not un-professional to offer a bigger package. It's totally ok to ask for your price. Go with a number in our mind to ask for the amount we want.

It is foolish which says that they will only give 30% of hike from rge previous salary.

Don't fall into the trap that the salary will increase more or you will get promoted easily in coming years. They are just foolisng us in this matter.

Negotiate on the base salary, but also ask for the ESOP's. Some companies also do not buy the ESOP's from you as this will come with certain terms and conditions. Some companies might show how the salary is increased if we add ESOP's in CTC as it will be added in the Salary.

It is ok to negotiate. It is hardwork for the HR to schedule interview, it is really difficult to find another candidate.

If we are shortening the Notice Period, so just tell them to increase the Joining Bonus.

Software Engineers Can Earn much more. Software Engineers are sometimes less vocal here, we Software Engineers have a lot to cover now as we are at the start of the rise in the path.

There is high shortage for good Software Engineers. We can ask for the better package.
