1. **Is JSX mandatory for React?**
   No, JSX is not mandatory for React, but it is highly recommended. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes React code more readable and easier to write, but you can still write React applications using pure JavaScript without JSX.

2. **Is ES6 mandatory for React?**
   ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features such as arrow functions, classes, and destructuring are not strictly mandatory for React development, but they are commonly used and highly recommended. Many modern React features and best practices rely on ES6 syntax to improve code readability and maintainability.

3. **{TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX**
   - `{TitleComponent}`: This renders the `TitleComponent` without wrapping it in a JSX tag. It is typically used when you want to render a component inline within another component.
   - `{<TitleComponent/>}`: This renders the `TitleComponent` using JSX self-closing syntax. It is equivalent to `<TitleComponent />` and is commonly used when rendering components with properties.
   - `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`: This is also valid JSX syntax for rendering `TitleComponent`. It's similar to the second option but explicitly uses opening and closing tags.

4. **How can I write comments in JSX?**
   You can write comments in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and using JavaScript comment syntax. For example:
   ```jsx
   {/* This is a JSX comment */}
   ```

5. **What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?**
   `<React.Fragment>` or `<>` is a JSX syntax that allows you to return multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. It's useful when you don't want to wrap your elements in a div or any other unnecessary container.

6. **What is Virtual DOM?**
   The Virtual DOM is a programming concept where an ideal or "virtual" representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM by a library such as React. This process makes updating the UI more efficient because the virtual DOM can be updated more quickly than the real DOM.

7. **What is Reconciliation in React?**
   Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM in response to changes in state or props. React compares the previous and current states of components and determines the most efficient way to update the DOM to match the new state.

8. **What is React Fiber?**
   React Fiber is a complete rewrite of React's core algorithm. It was introduced to improve performance, particularly for large and complex applications. Fiber introduces the concept of asynchronous rendering, allowing React to prioritize and interrupt rendering work to increase responsiveness.

9. **Why do we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?**
   Keys are used in React to identify unique components or elements in a list. They help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys are needed whenever you render a list of components or elements in React.

10. **Can we use index as keys in React?**
    While using the index as keys is possible, it's generally not recommended, especially if the list is dynamic and items can be added, removed, or reordered. Using index as keys can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when items are reordered or deleted, as it doesn't uniquely identify the elements.

11. **What is props in React? Ways to...**
    Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components in React. They are read-only and help in making components reusable. There are different ways to pass props in React, such as:
    - Directly passing props when rendering a component.
    - Using default props.
    - Using spread attributes to pass props dynamically.

12. **What is a Config Driven UI?**
    A Config Driven UI is an approach where the structure and behavior of a user interface are defined by configuration rather than hard-coding it in the application logic. This allows for more flexibility and easier customization of the UI without changing the underlying code. Configuration can be in the form of JSON objects, YAML files, or any other format that can be interpreted by the application.
